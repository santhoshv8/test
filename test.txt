3. Ganeralized classes means sub classes and 
   speclialized means super classes.

4. a) You should declared your class as final. 
      A class declared as final can't be extended by any other class.

   b)java.lang.String , object .
   
   c)Alternatives of Inheritance 
      interface
	 consider using an object as an alternative to inheritance.

5. comparator , comparable , collection.sort.

6. *linkedlist are node based where as Arraylist are index based.
   *linkedlist are store node order where as Arraylist are stored in sequential order. 
   *LinkedList is faster in manipulation of data where as ArrayList is slower in manipulation of data.
   
7. *listiterator traverse onlt lists where as iterator traverse list , set and map .
   *In listiterator can add an element by using add() where as in iterator can not add an element.
   *In listiterator traverse element  both forword and backword direction where as in iterator traverse an element in forword direction.

10. static polymorphism
     The methods declare more then once with same name but different in the parameter list is known as static polymorphism.
	 
	dynamic polymorphism
	If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, 
	it is known as dynamic polymorphism.
	 
11. declare the class as private.
